# JS-Practice ðŸ”¥
This is my practice repo where I try to go from basic to advanced concepts.


## Let, const and var ...

### Var :

Var is a global scope variable when we declare outside any function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.


### Let :


### Const :


# Data Types  :

ðŸ”µ Primitive = > Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, Bigint 

ðŸ”µ Non Primitive (Refrence Type ) = >   Array , Object ,  function 


 Number: store only number value.
 
 bigint: Store the large value of integer type.

 string  : store only string .

 boolean: Store only true or false 

 undefined: special type in data type in js.

 null: standalone value it's a type  empty value.Null is an object 

 symbol: used for unique values.

 object : 


# Array :

JavaScript Array is a single variable that is used to store elements of different data types. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed. The Javascript Arrays are not associative in nature.
Arrays are used when we have a list of items. An array allows you to store several values with the same name and access them by using their index

# Methods 

* push() => add elements to the end of the array 

* pop() => remove elements to the end of the array

* unshift() => add elements to the start of the array 

* shift() => remove elements to start of the array

* includes() => return true or false based on the operation of finding elements.

* indexOf() => return the index of elements 

* join() => join the array elements by commas and pipes.

* slice() => return the elements method returns selected elements in an array, as a new array.
The slice() method selects from a given start, up to a (not inclusive) given end.


### Methods ( iterative)

* every()

* filter()

* find()

* findIndex()

* findLast()

* findLastIndex()

* flatMap()

* forEach()

* map()

* some()


## Shallow Copy 

A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change.

## Deep copy 

A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you can be assured you're not causing the other object to change too.
